<h2 id="gcc">{% trans "Girls Can Code!" %}</h2>
<p class="text-justify">{% blocktrans %}Prologin is an association whose original purpose was to organize a computer science 
contest. In 2014, Prologin started to organize the Girls Can Code! summer camps.
These training camps are the perfect occasion for young girls who are still in middle school or in high school 
to discover multiple computer science subjects throughout the week. They will learn how to solve problems with 
algorithms, explore various computer science topics such as network, web development, robotics, microcontrollers, video games 
and more through practical exercises.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p class="text-justify">{% blocktrans %}Conferences from exterior speakers are organized for every camp. It enables the attendees 
to exchange with women working in the computer science industry or in academia. The young girls are sometimes 
unsure as to what they want to do, this is a golden occasion for them to discuss their education with the speaker, 
thus helping them for future orientation choices.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p class="text-justify">{% blocktrans %}Prologin staff is present during the camp to help them debug their programs and pass on 
knowledge in computer science and programming.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h2 id="organization">{% trans "Prologin : a computer enthusiasts organization" %}</h2>
  {% blocktrans %}<p class="text-justify">The purpose of Prologin's contest is to enable young computer enthusiasts to meet and compete with one another. Indeed,
computer science is still largely under represented in French schools. Therefore, those who practice it are
often self-taught and have an individual practice of it. However, any large project requires teamwork. This is
why, even though candidates seat the exam individually, the competition should facilitate the exchange of ideas
between candidates. To promote these exchanges, the Prologin team tries to design the contest topics so they
put forward playful aspects. Meanwhile, everything is done so that participants can and should exchange ideas
within a cheerful atmosphere. Combining work and pleasure is therefore a key objective of Prologin.</p>

<p class="text-justify">We want to allow the candidates to take advantage of the competition to enhance their skills. We try to cover as
many areas of computer science: artificial intelligence algorithms, general culture, various programming
languages…</p>

<p class="text-justify">For the organizers, the competition is an opportunity to manage a team and to organize a event. We must also
learn how to communicate effectively in order to make it known to a wider public. Managing relations with
sponsors, creating statements and solving both technological and logistic issues are also an enriching
experiences for our staff members.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Finally, for all the survivors who reach the final, it is also the opportunity to spend a super crazy weekend
with us!</p>
